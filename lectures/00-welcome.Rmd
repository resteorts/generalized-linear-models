## Generalized Linear Models

*In statistics, a generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.*[^1]

[^1]: Souce: [Generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model)

. . .

**Example: Logistic regression**

$$\begin{aligned}\pi = P(y = 1 | x) \hspace{2mm} &\Rightarrow \hspace{2mm} \text{Link function: } \log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big) \\
&\Rightarrow \log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x\end{aligned}$$

## Course learning objectives {.midi}

By the end of the semester, you will be able to ...

::: incremental
-   describe generalized linear models (GLMs) as a unified framework.
-   explain how specific models fit into the GLM framework
-   identify the appropriate model given the data and analysis objective.
-   analyze real-world data by fitting and interpreting GLMs.
-   use R for analysis and write reports
-   effectively communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience in writing.
:::

## Course topics

**Generalized Linear Models**

-   Review of distributions, likelihoods, and regression
-   Introduce models for non-normal response variables
-   Estimation, interpretation, and inference
-   Mathematical details of GLMs as a unified framework

## GLMs in practice {.small}

*"...we used **negative binomial regression** to model the association between the number of questions produced, race, and group after adjusting for the additional covariates age and years of education. **Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson regression models** were also considered...the negative binomial model was a good fit for the data given the **overdispersion** in the distribution of number of questions asked."*[^2]

*" ...a **logistic regression model** is used to test how the likelihood of a foul is affected by which team is the home team, the foul differential, and the score differential...The logistic regression was run under several specifications ... using **clustered observation standard errors**, with each game as a cluster. This is done as an attempt to adjust for the fact that **observations may not be independent** as required under the logistic specification.*[^3]

## Meet your classmates!

-   Get in groups of 2 - 3

-   Each person in the group...

    -   Introduce yourself
    -   Share a boring fact about yourself

-   Everyone will introduce one person from your group to the class

# Computing toolkit

## R and RStudio

- Install R and RStudio on your laptop

-   [Click here](../computing.html) for instructions to install RStudio and configure git


**or**


Access RStudio through [Docker container](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) provided by Duke OIT

- Reserve a generic **RStudio** container (there is no course specific container)

## Canvas and Gradescope

- All homework assignments will be uploaded to Gradescope and Canvas. 

- Gradescope allows more fair and balanced grading. 

- Canvas allows us to check the reproducibility of your work. 

- Unfortunately, there is no platform that does both (to my knowledge). 

- Feedback will be given in Gradescope and is individual and private. 

## Ed Discussion

-   Online discussion forum (like Piazza, etc.)

-   Platform to ask questions about course content, logistics, assignments, etc.

-   Content organized by channels. Before posting, please browse previous posts to see if your question has already been answered. If not, please post your question in the relevant channel.

-   Questions about grades, absences, and other private matters should be emailed to me with "STA 310" in the subject line.
