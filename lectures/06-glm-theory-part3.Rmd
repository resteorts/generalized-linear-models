## Exponential dispersion family

It is often convenient to write the exponential family as an **exponential dispersion model (EDM) family** to provide connections to applied analysis that we have covered. 

## Definition of the EDM family

Distributions in the EDM family have a probability function 

\begin{align}
P(y; \theta, \phi) &= a(y,\phi) \exp\{
\frac{(y \theta - k(\theta))}{\phi}
\}
\end{align}
